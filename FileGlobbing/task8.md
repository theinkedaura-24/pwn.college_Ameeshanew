# Tab completion
This challenge requires us to read a file whose name cannot be typed manually, forcing us to instead use the Tab key for auto-completion.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gZEFToBU5WZc-aBFjOcH-Z24tlo.0FN0EzNxwiN4AzNzEzW}`

```
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege 
pwn.college{gZEFToBU5WZc-aBFjOcH-Z24tlo.0FN0EzNxwiN4AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that tab completion is a powerful and essential shell feature for both speed and accuracy, as it correctly fills in filenames even when they are long or contain unusual characters.

## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my references.
