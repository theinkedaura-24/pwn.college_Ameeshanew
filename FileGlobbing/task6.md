# Mixing globs
This challenge asks us to combine bracket [] and asterisk * globs into a single pattern of 6 characters or less to match three specific files ("challenging", "educational", and "pwning").

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Iig-SO1iIWU1Xv20cEaCSqZ5IDM.QX1IDO0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

```hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Iig-SO1iIWU1Xv20cEaCSqZ5IDM.QX1IDO0wiN4AzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
I learned how to combine different glob operators together in one argument to create specific patterns that match files based on shared characteristics.

## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my references.
