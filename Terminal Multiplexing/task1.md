# Launching screen
My task is to use the screen command to create a virtual terminal. For this challenge, all I need to do is type screen and press Enter. This action will start a new session and reveal the flag. Afterwards, I'll type exit to close the session.


## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gEDHalXoUS6niqvv22rbfLapQUK.0VN4IDOxwiN4AzNzEzW}`

```Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{gEDHalXoUS6niqvv22rbfLapQUK.0VN4IDOxwiN4AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learned that screen is a terminal multiplexer that lets me create virtual terminal sessions, much like having tabs in a browser. 
I can start a new session by just typing screen. To close the session and return to my original shell, I use the exit command.

## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my references.
