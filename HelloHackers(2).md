# Intro to Arguments 
The challenge asks me to invoke a command with arguments.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UpwmzhbFRrYfsBqB0Yk6ymePOTI.QX4YjM1wiN4AzNzEzW}`

In the command line, I input the command hello with the argument hackers, and this gave me my flag.

## What I learned
I learnt that a command is usually followed by arguments. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. 

## References 
I used the video on pwn.college as my reference.
