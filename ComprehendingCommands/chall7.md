# touching files
The challenge asks us to create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college using the touch command, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{c86Jg7t_9p_PqGPP3BKSUIAtGNx.QXwMDO0wiN4AzNzEzW}`


```hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c86Jg7t_9p_PqGPP3BKSUIAtGNx.QXwMDO0wiN4AzNzEzW}

```
