# moving files
This challenge wants us to move the /flag file into /tmp/hack-the-planet! When we're done, we can run /challenge/check, which will check things out and give the flag to us.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gexJNC-2vuuijxXxE6kHMlRGX1a.0VOxEzNxwiN4AzNzEzW}`


```hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{gexJNC-2vuuijxXxE6kHMlRGX1a.0VOxEzNxwiN4AzNzEzW}
```
