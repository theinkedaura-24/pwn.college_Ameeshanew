# Setting Variables
This challenge asks us to assign the value "COLLEGE" to a shell variable named "PWN".

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YXDiJlY6G56zrsbsTbIWsgGcGiT.QX5UTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{YXDiJlY6G56zrsbsTbIWsgGcGiT.QX5UTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
You learn the correct syntax for variable assignment (VAR=VALUE), emphasizing that there must be no spaces around the = and that you do not use a $ when setting a variable


## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my reference.
