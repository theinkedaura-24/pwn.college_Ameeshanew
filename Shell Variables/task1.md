# Printing Variables
This challenge asks us to use the echo command to print the value stored inside a shell variable named FLAG.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UFCmlA_uusBCbBTF2IPOwkxBYmQ.QX3UTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

```
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{UFCmlA_uusBCbBTF2IPOwkxBYmQ.QX3UTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
I learned the concept of shell variables: we access a variable's content by prefixing its name with a dollar sign ($)

## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my references.
