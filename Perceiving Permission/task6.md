# Permission tweaking practice

My goal is to complete a chmod practice game by running /challenge/run. 
The program will ask me to set specific permissions on the /challenge/pwn file. 
I must correctly apply the requested permissions eight times in a row to win, which will then allow me to chmod /flag and read it.



## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IY5EKYd0crWQm5zW3ZTxwTWYoKR.QXwEjN0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions

```

## What I learned
I learned to apply my chmod knowledge in a practical, multi-step scenario, which reinforced my understanding of setting specific user, group, and other permissions.
This challenge highlighted the importance of precision, as I had to get every permission set exactly right to proceed and solidify my skills.
