# implicit relative path
In this level, we'll practice referring to paths using . a bit more. This challenge will need us to run it from the /challenge directory.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EdR44acB2sQ6YQf2Cut_o5pRVip.QXxUTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

```hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EdR44acB2sQ6YQf2Cut_o5pRVip.QXxUTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I practised using . a bit more and also practised more to use cd to go into the correct directory.

## References 
I used the resources available on pwn.college as my references.
