# Program and absolute paths
This challenge requires us to execute it by invoking its absolute path. We want to execute the run file that is in the challenge directory, which is, in turn, in the / directory. If we invoke the challenge correctly, it will give us the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cE2wg7uN3y1H9JVUFAGut4mwOHY.QX1QTN0wiN4AzNzEzW}`

This challenge required us to execute it by invoking its absolute path so as to run a file that is in the challenge directory, which, in turn, is the / directory I input :
/challenge/run

which gives me my flag.

## What I learned
I learned how to invoke the absolute path to run a file.

## References 
I used the video available on pwn.college as my reference.
